# sentences.101
Website to emulate Valve's vox system in GoldSrc engine in your browser.

https://mfaizsyahmi.github.io/sentences.101/

# introduction

The Goldsrc engine uses sentences.txt as an abstraction for game sounds, allowing entities to emit "sentence names" instead of hard-coding sound paths. It also allows for chaining many sounds into a single sentence. Finally, there is a basic modifier system to adjust start and end times, volume, pitch, and speed of each (or every) sound in sentences.

Sentences.101 emulates the above system in your browser to allow you to more conveniently tinker and test your own sentences, without the overhead of running the game engine and the limitations of the engine's console.
